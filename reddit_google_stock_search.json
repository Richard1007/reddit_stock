      "selftext": "No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-could-fall-as-much-as-25-in-black-swan-event-if-judge-orders-google-chrome-divestiture-174438942.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-could-fall-as-much-as-25-in-black-swan-event-if-judge-orders-google-chrome-divestiture-174438942.html)\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock could drop between 15% and 25% if US District Judge Amit Mehta orders Google to sell off its Chrome browser, Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday.\n\nIn August 2024, Google lost a landmark antitrust trial against the US Department of Justice. Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text\" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.\n\nLast Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.\n\nBarclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”\n\nSandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.\n\n“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”\n\nSandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet’s earnings per share.\n\n“The reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),” Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nMehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case — and the fate of Google’s search empire — in August. Google said Saturday that it will appeal the case.\n\nSeparately on Monday, Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders accusing the company of antitrust violations.\n\nAlphabet stock fell 1.5% on Monday, and shares are down 10.6% year to date.",

Then fought to stay relevant in mobile. Then won the browser wars by just being *better* or more liked. They are now fighting with Amazon for shopping. And now their biggest challenge is the AI risk that threatens their Google Search and they are fighting to provide the best models in the world. \n\nAnd people have used Google because overall, they like it the best. And for things they don't like that google produced, like Pixel, Google Plus, google workspace etc, they are not the #1 product in the market. \n\nmakes no sense to break out Chrome.

It has become terrible in recent years at finding what you're looking for, whereas AI engines are very efficient. Younger generations, which are usually the first to catch on to new trends, have ditched Google in favor of AI search products like ChatGPT.\n\nRight now, Google is literally just propped up by monopoly tactics. Search engine default deals with android phone manufacturers, deals to have their apps preinstalled, Google being the default engine in Chrome. Their core product just isn't good at what it does. But consumers are slow to switch.\n\nIf the default search engine of Chrome changes, as well as Safari, Google is going to lose the majority of its users and therefore its revenue.

If you only look at Windows(where Google is not default), the number is substantially lower, probably closer to 60-70%.\n\n2.  Edge is a lousy browser compared to Chrome, so a lot of people use Chrome, and Google is the default search engine.  If it was the search engine that was the issue, people would just set Chrome as their search engine within edge. \n\n3. AI Search products do not show up in Search engine market share charts. So if I use ChatGPT, Grok, etc to answer my question, that isn't logged as search engine activity. So arguing Google has 80% market share is like Arguing that Kodak still has 90% market share of camera film and traditional cameras, so digital cameras aren't a threat.\n\n4. Google's presence on mobile influences desktop decisions. If your Android phone comes with Google apps, Google chrome, obviously you want Google on your PC to sync with mobile. But what if your phone no longer comes with Google preinstalled due to anti-trust action? Then the decision is no longer made for you.",

Without directing everyone to a search engine chrome is worth almost nothing, and without Chrome google search would have less users and an eroded moat. Chrome as the biggest browser also gives Google a huge amount of power to push web standards and APIs in their favor. There's a really high degree of synergy here. You have similar synnergies with their other products. Take youtube - a good platform for injecting ads into user's eyeballs. They're gathering data from those same users through their google searches, through their gmails, maps usage etc in order to target the best ad on youtube. And their youtube watch history provides more data to show the correct ad in search etc. They use all this data to train their AI models as well. If this all gets broken up then each individual business is massively weakened. There are tonnes more examples like this - they host their products on their own google cloud without having to pay, for example.",

          "body": "Gemini, when asked what epistemic humility is:\n\nEpistemic humility is a philosophical concept that refers to the recognition and acceptance of the inherent limits and fallibility of one's own knowledge and understanding. It's an intellectual virtue that stands in contrast to epistemic arrogance, which is the unwarranted belief in one's own intellectual superiority or the certainty of one's knowledge.\nHere are the key aspects of epistemic humility:\n * Acknowledgment of limitations: It involves understanding that our knowledge is always incomplete, provisional, and subject to revision. We don't and can't know everything.\n * Openness to revision: A person with epistemic humility is willing to re-evaluate their beliefs in light of new evidence, different perspectives, or compelling arguments. They are not rigidly attached to their current understanding.\n * Awareness of bias and interpretation: It recognizes that our perception and understanding of the world are shaped by our existing beliefs, experiences, cultural background, and cognitive biases. We acknowledge that our knowledge is always \"interpreted, structured, and filtered by the observer.\"\n * Curiosity and continuous learning: Rather than leading to apathy, epistemic humility fosters a mindset of ongoing intellectual investigation and growth. It encourages questioning, seeking new information, and engaging in constructive dialogue.\n * **Socrates' \"knowing that I know nothing\": This famous dictum from Socrates is often cited as an early example of epistemic humility. He recognized that his wisdom lay in his awareness of his own ignorance, unlike others who claimed to know much but actually knew little.\n * Avoiding overconfidence: It means expressing one's beliefs with a degree of confidence that is justified by the evidence, rather than making absolute or dogmatic claims.\nIn essence, epistemic humility is about maintaining an open, inquisitive, and self-critical stance towards one's own knowledge, fostering a disposition that is conducive to learning, critical thinking, and respectful intellectual engagement.",

In fact Google is a monopoly over search of 90% which makes it far worse than the railroad companies and banks the Sherman Act was originally passed to regulate. Trying to say that they only have 30% of the advertising market is disingenuous as the railroad companies only had a very small share of the overall transportation market.

Meta and Microsoft trades at 10x and 13x price to sales ratio with similar gross margins.\n\nAd network I gave a 10x price to sales ratio for similar reasons. Very high margin business.\n\nCloud I said is worth about half of what AWS is worth since AWS does \\~2x the revenue (Google better YoY growth though). At a total market cap of 2.2T the very low margin retail side of the business is worth maybe 700B which is comparable to Walmart so the bulk of Amazon valuation is 1.5T attributable to high margin AWS cloud business.\n\nWaymo I pulled out of my rear and tried to be reasonable. Other much less successful self driving car companies like Aurora and Mobileye trade at 10B and 13B. Whereas Tesla has nearly 1.1T in market cap with most of that based on the success of robotaxi. I erred on the low end here but bulls might argue Waymo is worth significantly more.\n\nAI hardware is really intertwined with Deepmind and their Gemini models and that drives some of the value here. They offer unmatched token efficiency (cost per token) compared to ChatGPT and Anthropic and Grok. 200B admittedly might be too high but AMD is another fabless semi worth 200B.\n\nSearch is also very high margin business but I assigned a price to sales multiple of 5x and valuation of 1T to be conservative based on risk from AI disruption to Search.",

Plus the benefit of working (or scrolling brainrot) on your commute, without having to share space on public transport. Waymos also don’t seem to kill as many people as Teslas, and that feels important for a taxi company, more so than a sports car company.",

          "body": "Alphabet lost two antitrust lawsuits. One was due to its 90% share of search which they illegally paid off companies like Apple to put them as the preference and the second was in publisher ad servers and the market for ad exchanges, which sit between buyers and sellers. Websites use publisher ad servers to store and manage their ad inventories. Again you are trying to conflate total advertising revenue to ignorantly prove that it is not a monopoly. Don’t you think the railroad cartels didn’t also claim road and shipping was a direct competitor? It didn’t fly in the 1890s it won’t fly today.",

          "body": "Google has entire segments that are straight up not profitable on their own and only provide value as part of the greater ecosystem. This this includes the entire G-Suite, Chrome, their work on Android, etc.\n\nGoogle Cloud and YouTube also benefit massively by having access to cheap Google TPUs. Otherwise, they would have to pay much greater computation costs and lose some of their advantages over the competition. Especially Google Cloud would have an incredibly difficult time competing with AWS and Azure. Both of which are at various stages of deploying their own accelerator hardware to reduce costs. Azure also has the advantage of providing better access to Microsoft software. Google Cloud would have nothing and slowly lose market share.\n\nAt the same time, Google TPUs require internal knowledge of the software stack and would be difficult to sell to other companies who already have a staff of engineers trained on Nvidia hardware.\n\nDeepMind can not exist in it's current form without being integrated into a large tech conglomerate that provides the funding. It's the modern Bell Labs.\n\nGoogle Search benefits from being the default on Android and Chrome.\n\nGoogle's AD business relies on the seamless integration between services and ability to track users across services and devices. \n\nYou do not understand Google at any level if you don't realise how crucial synergy effects are for its individual segments. A lot of them could not exist without it and many others would lose their competitive edge and moat and slowly get pushed out of the market. They would have to compete with services that are integrated within the Microsoft/Amazon/Apple ecosystem.\n\nThe vast majority is Google is not profitable and only exists to prop up it's Search and Advertising business.\n\nIt's like breaking away the iPhone from the rest of the Apple ecosystem. It would drastically lose value.",

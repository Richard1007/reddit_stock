I'm talking an hour straight every time. This dude's dick must double as a metronome - that's how his\ntiming was. And it was directly above my bed. I must admit that I was chronically single at the time and I may have once of twice heard them getting after it and \"played along\". Weird but hey,\nif you're going to loudly fuck, I'm going to listen. Couple months later they invited me over for a drink. Found out they had their laundry machine right above my bed. Turns out, they were just platonic roommates and I jerked off to their\nwashing machine.",

I got the mowing done today so hopefully the last of the fucking rye the sewer construction guy strewed all over my yard is dead now, because it was the placeholder for where I'll put the pumpkins. I've recently discovered that amaranth greens are fucking delicious, so I'll be broadcasting those all over the yard too.\n\nIn other news, 3 of the apricot seeds I planted have finally come up, and tons of tomato volunteers have come up from the compost in the new raised beds too. Hundreds of ground cherries I intentionally planted have come up too. All these beds have a couple inches of manure on top so I'm hoping for an excellent crop this year. Oh, and my temperate paddle cactuses in pots on the porch look like they might bloom so I might have some fruits to share with the yard turtles too.",

          "body": "Saturday night, listening to Deconstructed by 10 Years. Digging it so far. \n\n[FT opinion piece: Does Moody‚Äôs US downgrade matter?](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed8372b-8a82-4198-b6c1-dd1b9ef8feaa)\n\n* So, does the downgrade matter to financial plumbers this time? From a mechanical perspective, the answer is almost certainly ‚Äúnot at all‚Äù. Banks‚Äô risk-weighted capital asset calculations look unlikely to be impacted by the rating change. This is because regulators don‚Äôt tend to differentiate between Aaa and Aa1 when setting capital risk-weights. \\[...\\]Moody‚Äôs could‚Äôve done a three-notch downgrade ‚Äî from Aaa all the way to Aa3 ‚Äî and nothing would‚Äôve changed on this front.\n* How about collateral management? A note from Barclays on Friday night looked at the implications.... \"Legislation since the financial crisis has reduced the use of explicit ratings guidelines in investment mandates.\"\n* Moving away from financial markets, the downgrade may well matter to Moody‚Äôs themselves. If S&P Global Ratings‚Äô experience in 2011 is anything to go by, the firm will be in for a rough ride. Following S&P‚Äôs downgrade more than a decade ago, US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner threw a bit of a public wobbly, and filmmaker Michael Moore called on Obama to arrest the firm‚Äôs CEO.\n* Meanwhile, and apparently unrelatedly, the Justice Department launched an investigation into S&P. Within a few weeks, CEO Deven Sharma had left the company. When things moved from being just an investigation to an actual $5bn federal lawsuit for allegedly misleading banks about the credibility of its ratings before the 2008 financial crisis, S&P called this direct retaliation for its downgrade.\n* And in its previous rating report reaffirming the Aaa rating back in November 2023, Moody‚Äôs wrote: \"A weakening of institutions and governance strength, such as through deterioration in monetary and macroeconomic policy effectiveness or the quality of legislative and judicial institutions, could also strain the rating.\" The world has moved on since 2023, and Moody‚Äôs is marking-to-market.",

That's just what we know of. They refer to themselves as 'the board of \ndirectors' and us as the minimods.\nReddit's system for subreddit ownership is broke and we begged for help.\nThe other plan is that some friend of the top mod's has wormed into his brain and is going to use WSB as a springboard to launch some stupid \ncrypto shit. We're supposed to be impressed and bend over because he says the name winklevoss. We can't stop it. No matter how hard we try \nto keep the ship stable and moving in the direction it's been moving for years... we continue to be saddled with this team of losers that \nwants nothing more than to return to cash in on something they didn't even have a hand in making.\nOne of them fucking asked 'what's fuckboy' yesterday. You should see some of the screenshots I have.\nYou deserve to know that this place is being sold out on multiple levels by the people at the top, and that everyone below them wants them \ngone and is heartbroken.\nThey'll probably take this down and remove me and hire some asshole to replace me. Fuck it. Hi CNN. Fucking hilarious some assholes trying \nto call us OWS when we're literally being occupied.\nNo politics.

Never liked him, never liked his credit ratings, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he‚Äôs not a talented guy ‚Äî Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country. If I wasn‚Äôt elected, it would have been GONE by now! Sleepy Joe didn‚Äôt have a clue as to what he was doing, but Moody is ‚Äúdumb as a rock,‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out ‚Äúprune‚Äù of a credit rater (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that‚Äôs just ‚Äústandard fare.‚Äù Then we‚Äôll all see how it goes for him!",

      "selftext": "I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.\n\n**Some quick points:**\n\n**1. Price to earnings ratio**\n\nPrice to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.\n\nThe entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.\n\nWho in the world would be interested in signing up for that \"investment\" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.\n\n**2. The Buffett indicator**\n\nThe Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.\n\nHistorically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.\n\n**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**\n\nThe Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.\n\nSide note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?\n\n**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**\n\nI won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.\n\nIts highest percent¬†*until*¬†the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  \n30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.\n\nThe condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.\n\nForeclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.\n\nWhat happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?\n\nWhat does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --\n\nWhen homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.\n\n**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**\n\nCredit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.\n\nAuto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.\n\n**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**\n\nThe US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.\n\n**7. Commercial real estate**\n\nA massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.\n\n**8. Student Loan Debt**\n\nThe government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?\n\nThere is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.\n\nI would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.\n\n  \nCurrent options positions I hold: \n\n11 $480 SPY puts Exp 9/19  \nAlso holding 15 IBIT $70 calls expiring 9/19 as well",

Given the easy access retail now has to investing, you get stocks like Tesla and Palantir which are cheerleaders and always win the popularity contest. There‚Äôs too much new money from the last 10 years that does not care or even understands fundamentals so they have only seen the market go up and buying the dip on the highest beta names has been the continued win. On top of that, you have a corrupt system that is willing to manipulate the markets with debt in an effort to inflate asset prices given today‚Äôs economy is asset based. Nobody actually has money, it‚Äôs all perceived wealth that‚Äôs sitting in home equity, 401k, Robinhood account, so in the end the actual economy only matters for the 95% of the people that have no power, money, or influence. This makes it so that as long as the top 5% are healthy they can carry everyone else by spending and generating artificial revenue on a dying zombie economy. If you really want to understand what will crash this economy look into private credit, it‚Äôs the equivalent of mbs in 2008. Most small to mid sized companies that hire all the people are just zombie companies bankrolled by private credit that has lost substantial value but does not need to be remarked. The rising yields has been choking these companies in interest payments and banks just continue to accept riskier and riskier borrowers as long as the interest is high. Companies are paying upwards of 15% in interest for this debt, best way to illustrate the situation is imagine you‚Äôre alone in a life raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You‚Äôre still technically alive, but barring a miracle it‚Äôs just a matter of time until you die. It can either be a storm, sharks, or some other form of forced injury (compare this to tariffs or any other self made changes to the system that trigger the break) or just time because you will either starve, die of thirst, skin disease from the sun, etc (think of this as the idea that these companies cannot sustain themselves in the long run and they will just slowly have to fire more and more people just like many others creating a vicious cycle of unemployment, consumer exhaustion with no money to spend in businesses, leading to more unemployment, etc.). However, the reason investors are willing to ignore this is because time and time again when this danger is upon us our lord and savior federal reserve/government bails out the economy with even more stimulus and debt. Long story short is that the system is broken since it just continues to feed itself, this only stops when people stop believe in the system because I don‚Äôt think the fed or the government will ever stop taking the easy way out",

The fact that none of the top posts are pointing this out is concerning since people take real opinions from Reddit.\n\nFirst of all, you're describing a Price to Sales ratio, not Price to Earnings. Second of all, you're omitting the growth aspect from a growth stock valuation.\n\nYour takeaway of years to get your money back makes no sense.\n\nIn addition, yes, the best tech companies in the world are located in the US, and they are a large portion of most index funds so that will push their valuations further up. Not to mention the dollar losing value due to high supply which would actually push that up as well.\n\nAnd yes, high quality American companies SHOULD command a premium price because what's the alternative? Chinese companies as a whole are risky simply from the fact that they've been fabricated before, and it's one's guess how fabricated it is now. Europe isn't the best at producing high growth companies for multiple reasons. Emerging countries like India come with their own risks.\n\nThat said, I do agree that some stocks (PLTR, TSLA) have some pretty lofty valuations, and that there's definitely going to be volatility during the next 3.5 years.",

It doesn't necessarily mean you should be buying puts on YSTN today, expecting it might erupt tomorrow.\n\nThe market has been overdue for a major correction for like the last 10 years. Doesn't mean it will happen tomorrow, could take 10 more years or, theoretically, could remain overvalued for the rest of your lives and never have a major correction.\n\nIf you're going to make a play on the assumption that it's overdue and therefore inevitable, you need to position yourself in a way that you can weather all of the storms that will come and go in the weeks, months, maybe even years or decades before it actually does happen. In other words, your play needs to be done with money you don't mind being tied up for potentially a very long time, and without using any interest-losing leverage.",

However, this also means that the S&P eps growth is about +20%, which is above average, and gives the market a 1.38x PEG ratio, which is right in the middle of it's long term range.\n\nAdditionally, the S&P earnings yield is about +2% over its dividend yield, which is again, right in line with long term averages, and profit margins are at all time highs and continuing to rise. \n\nWhile valuations have bounced off recent lows, they are a long way from \"disgustingly overvalued\".

For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.\"\n\nWe found the one who doesn't understand PE!\n\nYou did an absolutely horrific job in this post, I'm sorry to say.

If you pair this with the stock market being asymmetric you get these insane valuations, with asymmetric I‚Äôm referring to studies pointing towards the stockmarket being more effected by flows in/out. If I remember correctly a one dollar purchase of stock will increase total stock market valuation with about 5 dollars. \n\nI agree with the main point though that the valuations have detached from fundamentals. But I‚Äôd argue that‚Äôs an effect of low access to quality investments. I mean hell small companies that are 10x more profitable than the publicly traded companies are trading at far lower multiples. \n\nPeople have realized that saving money is very important and have the resources to do so. And the idea that the market will always continue up has been true so far. So you ultimately have an increasing pool of liquidity chasing the same limited supply of publicly traded quality companies. \n\nFrankly there‚Äôs not many things for people to do with their money. It‚Äôs all a big meme and the world might collapse tomorrow, but it might also 3x in the next 5 years. Ultimately we‚Äôre all gambling on the stock market keep on being the primary savings/investment vehicle for the decades to come.

Re: foreclosures: If someone were unable to make a mortgage payment most folks would have already sold their property as values have pretty well increased across the board since early 2020. Real estate is one of the few sectors I'm not really worried about.\n\n5. Correct, but we did see a bit of a turn around last quarter here. This certainly could be problematic but I don't think we're quite at Red Alert levels yet.\n\n6. Correct, but this isn't remotely an issue yet. I would be alarmed if you continued to see yields increase despite falling fed rates and a sinking stock market. The stock market needs to cool so people put their money into bonds in order to see yields come back down. Additionally, we've only slightly begun dropping fed rates. Stay tuned here.\n\n7. Correct, commercial real estate is fucked.\n\n8. Correct. This will be an issue if the economy can't get itself together and resume being hot. If Ol' OrangeFace can't get his act together on the economy I would expect to see mass defaults here.\n\n  \nOverall, I give you a B+!",

But I do want to sketch a different way the next ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù might unfold, one that‚Äôs more slow-drip than sudden-crash.\n\nBefore the tariffs hit and even after the ‚Äúpause,‚Äù you can see the same pattern of money edging away from the U.S. and sniffing around Europe or sturdier EM pockets. It isn‚Äôt the headline tariff number that rattles people so much as the sense the rules could get rewritten again three months from now.\n\nThe currency tape says it louder than stocks do. While the S&P kept trying to grind higher, the Swiss franc punched to a ten-year high against the dollar and hasn‚Äôt really backed off. For anyone funded in euros or francs, a softer buck means you only stick around U.S. equities if earnings yields get juicier - same profits, lower multiple. Easy math.\n\nHowever because America still offers the deepest, most liquid markets, money can‚Äôt just bolt for the exits. Think Japan after the 1990 bubble, the economy kept trundling along, but valuations leaked lower year after year while inflation nibbled away at real returns. Fresh capital is already drifting toward Euro-zone stocks or EM ETFs instead of defaulting to short-dated Treasuries.\n\nA slow pivot toward multipolar payments adds weight. BRICS isn‚Äôt unveiling a new reserve currency tomorrow, but its local-currency settlement rails chip at the automatic foreign-reserve bid under Treasuries. Fewer recycled trade surpluses chasing our debt forces the Treasury to sweeten the pot. Higher real yields, stickier mortgage and corporate borrowing costs.\n\nPut all that together and I‚Äôm not betting on a 40% crashout. Although that still feels very possible, I think it is equaly or even slightly more likely for a weaker dollar, reduction in US stock multiples, and funding costs that stay annoyingly high. Your September SPY puts make sense as an ‚Äúoh-crap‚Äù parachute, and the IBIT calls play the idea that anything outside fiat looks appealing if faith in the greenback keeps falling and falling. \n\nI‚Äôm also with you on that everything looks bad, but I would consider the possibility that the pain may arrive as a long, slow bleed instead of a headline recession.",

The biggest stock of the S&P 500 are owned by the big 7 tech .¬†\nThey have more liquidity , less debt , and better margin than than 15 years ago where the largest company operate with shitty margin.

There's a reason that market returns are positive over the long run. Cash producing assets simply have a positive return. Sure, the market at 28x earnings is frothy relative to history, but looking at it another way, markets are offering a 3.5% earnings yield. That doesn't sound great until you factor in growth - which has historically averaged 4% in real terms. Add on 2% in inflation, and you get 9.5% expected returns.\n\nOf course, you can start to factor in weaker economic growth and risk premium changes, but betting on negative long term returns is like trying to hold a beach ball under water. There's just an inherent upward force that you have to overcome.\n\nThe other thing is opportunity cost. I typically don't look at stock valuations in a vacuum, but rather compare against bond yields. If we were expecting 6% returns from stocks and 4.5% from bonds, then why would be hold an all-stock portfolio? I can even make the case that 10% expected stock returns and 4.5% bond returns still doesn't cost you that much in terms of portfolio returns if you hold some bonds. And, it gives you dry powder in the event that there is actually a crash.\n\nDoing that comparison, we aren't in a great spot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zh20ntvs2u0f1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1838ae8f51a8d7a2a6c0af36872d7b7c2c2cc6c\n\nToday, the spread between stock yields (as measured by CAPE ratio) and bond yields is -150 basis points. The **average** expected return for stocks over bonds is like 1.5%. There is a wide error, however. The early 1990s had similar levels and preceded the most euphoric bubble in history.\n\nAnd, **we're nowhere near peak dotcom levels** (the bottom left data point). In order to get to similar levels, the S&P 500 would have to rise 25% from here. More importantly, bond yields would have to rise 250 basis points.\n\nI'm very much in a risk neutral position, myself. It'd take something close to this scenario (above) for me to think about bailing on US equities completely.",

The difference then was that private equity firms, venture capitalists, and investment banks were given an enormous amount of free-ish money to throw at dot-com companies with no fundamentals. It was a crazy time. Lehmann Brothers gave this company $9 million because the CEO knew how to schmooze and hired a big Wall Street investment banker to be the CFO. By 2001, I saw that none of this was sustainable and a bubble would burst. I left to work at a non-profit. The crash happened and so did that company I worked for.",

Forward PE is a much better indicator of where a company is headed. Also you're not factoring in that growth potential is an inherent part of current valuation, which is why some companies have high PE ratios. This also explains why the s&p PE is 28 while historically it was ~20, it used to primarily be comprised of manufacturing and blue chips but now it's majority tech, which of course is much more productive with more growth potential so the historical PE ratio doesn't really mean much in a rapidly changing world.",

Well I missed the first bottom after it recovered to $540. In my infinite wisdom, I knew the market will bounce once before a recovery. I figured this time it's gotta touch $450, but no it stopped around $510. Missed it again, but I kept telling myself \"just watch, it's gonna dip one last time before mooning\".

I don't buy most of these arguments, but I am not in a position to completely debunk them either.\n\nSome factors that are different from past periods (not necessarily better, just different):\n\n* Lots of pension funds, index funds, 401Ks, etc. that *have* to buy into the market.\n* Stock buybacks. These used to be illegal, and probably should be again, but they do allow companies to prop up their stock price for better or for worse.\n* Foreign investors. Global wealth has skyrocketed since 2000. US stocks offer better returns than most other markets. Perhaps this is just a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it means there are a lot more buyers than in the past.\n* Low interest rates. There have been long stretches with very low interest rates in the past couple decades. Low interest rates tend to inflate bubbles (crypto, real estate, art, collectibles, meme stocks), but they also increase company profits.",

Inflation‚Äôs cooling, earnings are growing, no recession yet, and sentiment isn‚Äôt euphoric‚Äîclassic ‚Äúwall of worry‚Äù setup.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhat could kill it: Valuations are stretched (CAPE ~36), breadth is narrow (mega-cap tech is doing all the work), and if inflation flares or earnings miss, downside opens up fast.\n\t‚Ä¢\tTimeframe: If soft landing + AI narrative holds, this run could last another 12‚Äì24 months.

P/E might be used as a regressor for certain measures (financing, etc.) but not for market efficiency, you are mixing pears and apples. The price is a market measure (including risk premium) and earnings are a book one (adjusted by expenses, contrary to what you say).\n\n2. Love Buffett, but MV/GDP is a crap indicator. Why? Not because it is a bad idea, but because the numerator is too difficult to pin point. Different frequencies, and you need to control for globalization, spillovers, market concentration, and similar heterogeneities.\n\n3. I don't understand your point here.

So much money was put into circulation during COVID, so much spent, so much invested and bought up assets of all kinds, and the returns on those investments have been so good, the multiplier effect just took over.

Low unemployment in America is carrying on.

Housing market is mixed across the country but strong where it matters. Defaults at record lows. Commercial debt is being restructured and everyone is winning ‚Äî including the banks collecting fees. Also, the emergence of debt funds are totally changing the game ‚Äî smart folks like those at fortress and Cerberus buy up the weak hands and essentially serve as a backstop against total collapse. Student loans are an issue but not a big enough issue to collapse the economy. Credit card debt is also an issue but would only affect a few players and they are diversified enough to weather the storm (they will take a big hit, but they won‚Äôt fail). Many equities are indeed over priced but there is still value out there and we just saw a 20-35% drawdown that created tremendous opportunities for those who jumped. Bond market is a bit wacky but only because the idiot Chinese and Canadians tried to mess with the US and now everyone is paying. But we will work through it. Also, if you don‚Äôt like public equities, now is a great time to buy bonds with yields as high as they are.¬†\n\nThe biggest issue is in bonds and the fed rate. BUT because the economic indicators are still so strong, it‚Äôs too early to cut and doing so would risk rising inflation. Eventually, if rates stay high for much longer, it could become a problem but for now we are on the right track. J pow is watching closely and probably the best fed chair in history.

But, supply is not good relative to population and construction is not set to remediate that. Especially with forced shortages of construction labor due to immigration and border policy. This can compound the deterioration of existing units and further constrain supply.\n\nWhat backs me up on this is the high prices for Rented units. If rents were low, I think your prediction is right. But as rents are high, I would expect capital/ownership to transfer from the middle class to corporate and upper class landlords.",

If the inflows stop then the drop in assets will likely trigger outflows - this setup is primed for a runaway feedback loop.\n\n*In nominal dollar terms*, the Fed can make bonds be priced as high as they want - they can literally create new money and use it to buy bonds (at the cost of expanding their balance sheet, and possibly CPI inflation). ¬†They may not necessarily choose to do that but they could. They *can‚Äôt* buy stocks, so whether that new money also bids up stocks depends on whether anyone is willing to borrow money using bonds as collateral and buy stocks (probably yes).\n\n*In real purchasing power terms*, I think the value of both the dollar and dollar denominated assets depends entirely on the appetite of foreign investors for dollars - since it doesn‚Äôt seem US consumers or the US government are likely to stop overspending and start saving any time soon, certainly not to enough to make up for net inflows from abroad.\n\nIn short: if the Fed was absolutely dead set to raise bond prices/lower interest rates, they can certainly do so, and that would *probably* also lift stocks - in nominal terms. But the value of US dollars, bonds and stocks in terms of commodities or assets outside the US (eg ratio VOO/GLD, or VOO/VXUS) cannot be manipulated, and the overvaluation measured in those terms will almost certainly correct in a spectacular way eventually.",

Suppose it didn't have any value while I was learning the degrees. In that case, it certainly has NO value now that my degrees can't be transferred to anyone else... especially now that an AI can do BOTH of the things I went to university for (under the impression that I wasn't going to NEED to make money to pay the loans off... just note, everyone... back then, college was under a thousand dollars a semester). It's almost certain now that it got inflated on purpose to take advantage of our country's most intelligent, and their willingness to learn. That intelligence was a detriment.

These types of arguments could be summarized as \"treasury yields should never change\". The return is risk free, the price should be predictable at every point in time, and should follow an exact formula. But it doesn't.  \n  \nYep, P/E may blow relative to other times. But if you have a trillion dollars in capital chasing a hundred dollars in earnings, you get crappy P/E. It's the same reason why real estate cap rates can blow. And equity P/E competes with real estate cap rates, relatively.  \n  \nBut there's a bigger problem. Forget P/E, forget treasuries, forget cap rates. The real problem is that the Earth is finite. The known universe, physics, science, discovery, invention may not generate continuous increases in productivity forever. So if the economy is fueled solely by expansion and consumption, we'll meet our end at some point when we encounter the boundaries of the system. Instead, if the economy is fueled by increases in productivity, worsening P/E and cap rates may be a sign that we're not finding great new productivity increases. Which is a recipe for long term stagnation.  \n  \nAlong the way, correct or no correction could happen. But that's a short term concern overshadowed by the long term trajectory of humanity.",

          "body": "You always talk about AI but can't even use it for a simple summary, you just like to argue: Gemini please make sense of this thread discussion: Okay, let's rewrite the summary of the discussion and clarify OP's initial statement and the broader context of P/E ratios.\n\n\n**Revised Summary of the Discussion:**\n\n\nThe discussion began with the original poster (OP) expressing concern about the high Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. OP attempted to illustrate the implications of a high P/E ratio by using a hypothetical scenario where NVIDIA had no expenses. This led to immediate corrections from other users who pointed out that the \"Earnings\" in the P/E ratio already accounts for all expenses.\n\n\nSeveral commenters, including u/Whattheyeballsdid, u/idanfl8, and u/OkTheory2661, correctly stated that P/E is Price divided by *Earnings*, not Sales, and that earnings are net income (revenue *minus* expenses). u/fridgekkd initially focused on the wording of OP's hypothetical rather than the financial inaccuracy.\n\n\nThe conversation then branched into discussions about trailing P/E versus forward P/E (which uses future earnings estimates), with u/Whattheyeballsdid and u/OkTheory2661 highlighting the importance of forward-looking metrics. u/jackywackyjack introduced Price-to-Revenue (P/R) as an alternative metric.\n\n\nMikoIsAwesome correctly identified that OP's hypothetical scenario of a 28-year payback period with no expenses was flawed, suggesting OP might have been thinking of Price-to-Sales. Eventually, OP acknowledged their confusion between P/S and P/E but maintained their concern about the long payback period implied by the current P/E ratios.\n\n\n**Correction and Interpretation of OP's Initial Statement:**\n\n\nOP's fundamental error was stating that the P/E ratio doesn't include expenses. **This is incorrect.** The \"E\" in P/E stands for Earnings per Share (EPS), which is a company's net profit divided by its outstanding shares. Net profit is calculated *after* all operating expenses, interest, taxes, and other costs have been deducted from revenue.\n\n\nTherefore, OP's hypothetical scenario of a company having no expenses and then calculating a payback period based on the current P/E ratio is based on a misunderstanding of the metric. The P/E ratio already reflects the impact of a company's expenses on its profitability.\n\n\n**What OP Was Likely Trying to Say About P/E and Above-Average Levels:**\n\n\nDespite the flawed hypothetical, OP's underlying concern about the high P/E ratio of the S&P 500 likely stems from the following understanding:\n\n\n* **High P/E implies a longer payback period *relative to earnings*:** A P/E of 28 for the S&P 500 suggests that investors are currently paying 28 times the current annual earnings for a share in those companies. If earnings were to remain constant, it would theoretically take 28 years for the cumulative earnings to equal the initial investment.\n* **High P/E can indicate overvaluation:** Historically, the average P/E ratio of the S&P 500 has been lower than the current levels (the long-term historical average is often cited around 15-16, though this can vary depending on the time period considered). A significantly higher P/E ratio can suggest that the market is overvalued, meaning investors are paying a premium for each dollar of earnings. This premium might be justified by expectations of strong future growth, low interest rates, or other factors, but it also carries the risk of a potential correction if those expectations are not met.\n* **OP's \"no expenses\" thought experiment (though flawed) was likely an attempt to simplify the concept of payback:** By imagining a scenario without expenses, OP was trying to highlight that even in a best-case (and unrealistic) scenario where all revenue becomes profit, a high P/E still implies a long time to recoup the investment based on current earnings. This, despite the incorrect premise, reflects a concern about the *price* investors are currently paying relative to the *earnings* they are receiving.\n\n\nIn essence, OP's concern is valid in the context of historical P/E ratios. A P/E of 28 (and even higher figures mentioned for the Nasdaq) is indeed above the historical average, which can raise questions about market valuation and future returns. However, the explanation using the \"no expenses\" scenario was based on a misunderstanding of how the P/E ratio is calculated.",

The Treasury in rolling over low-interest debt issued in the 00s to higher interest debt today. One reason tRump wants lower rates is to make that US debt less expensive. However, TBills will always be the safe bet and those will suck capital out of the market. 50% of all debt is getting rolled over from June-September.\n\n2. Tariff drama will cause shortages that will raise inflation. However, Baby boomers are retiring at a large enough clip that the labor pool is reducing by 900K people/year. That will have wage inflation impact over the next several years. Tariffs are designed to raise prices so there's more inflation.  The goal--supposedly--is to bring manufacturing back to the US, but he tariffed all the raw materials to build manufacturing back, including the industrial components we need from China to build the factories! Add in 104 policy changes in 53 days and investors are at a stand-still. Industrial MFG was booming and he drove that to zero until things calm down.\n\n3. All your points on the housing sector are valid, but honestly you're not bearish enough. With insurance rates spiking some insurers are simply leaving entire states. If you can't get insurance you can't get a mortgage. I think housing prices will collapse and some folks will be forced to sell for major losses, and a large chunk of those owners are corporate owners who gobbled everything up for cash in 2010s-2022.\n\nAdditionally, home building is going to get way more expensive because all the raw materials are now tariffed, and so many of the day laborers on construction sites are undocumented immigrants. They're so afraid they might not just show up to work anymore. Not to mention when you have major events like the LA fires and hurricanes, the prices of materials in that area also skyrocket, making reinsurance that much more expensive.\n\n4. With all the inflationary pressure people will leave dollars for denominated assets: equities, crypto, gold etc. \n\nSo yeah...you are generally right and things are going to hurt, but I honestly don't know if we'll see it declines in the market based on fundamentals or if the market becomes the go-to to protect against inflation.",

If yield goes up by 10 bps, the new price would be 97.371 (4.58 yield), so .785 difference in price. A price change of 10 *ticks* is equal to 10/32 of one dollar (.3125), which is not equivalent.\n\nAlso consider that when you say \"tick,\" it refers to price and not yield. You said that the 10 year went \"up 80 ticks.\" When prices go up, yields go down, which is the opposite thing you were trying to say. (I think)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick_size",

I‚Äôm somewhat of a bear myself as well, but I want to find really strong evidence, and in my mind the credit card analysis was particularly weak, and hadn‚Äôt been addressed as far as I saw.\n\nThat being said, the first question you ask in response is framed incorrectly in my mind (delinquency rates jumping so dramatically)‚Äî for example, would a person from anytime *pre* 2011 consider our rates troublesome? No ‚Äî they would probably consider this a *bullish* signal, as they‚Äôd be lower than any time they knew in history. \n\nSimilarly, imagine delinquency was at 10% for 20 years in a row, then dropped to basically 0% for a few years, then rose quickly back to 10% within 1 year. While that last year could indicate things are bad, it could also just be a reversion to the mean, with the 0% years being the outlier rather than times where things were good.\n\nAm I saying that‚Äôs what happening now? No, but I‚Äôm offering a plausible differential analysis that doesn‚Äôt paint nearly as bad as a picture, which means we need some different evidence that credit card debt is actually in a bad place if we want it to hold credence.\n\nRE: FHA borrowers / student loans, I think bringing back these payments will definitely add pain to the consumer, but as to whether it will cause these rates to spike more probably again depends on the *amount* of pain it inflicts. If anything I think it will be a factor leading to an eventual crash, but it won‚Äôt be the tipping factor ‚Äî the tipping factor causing a correction in the market will probably still be years out, triggered probably by a world event (see: Japanese yen interest rates causing a small correction that came a bit out of nowhere).",

If you can't get insurance you can't get a mortgage. I think housing prices will collapse and some folks will be forced to sell for major losses, and a large chunk of those owners are corporate owners who gobbled everything up for cash in 2010s-2022.\n\n>Additionally, home building is going to get way more expensive because all the raw materials are now tariffed, and so many of the day laborers on construction sites are undocumented immigrants. They're so afraid they might not just show up to work anymore. Not to mention when you have major events like the LA fires and hurricanes, the prices of materials in that area also skyrocket, making reinsurance that much more expensive.\n\nI think both of these points more indicate housing prices staying high, not lowering. You are speaking to a lack of new builds, which will only increase demand. Why would people sell their house/mortgage at a loss when they may not be able to get another due to expense or lack of insurance coverage? You haven‚Äôt indicated why this would affect existing homeowners vs hopeful prospective ones, and I say this as someone in the latter category.",

No one knew what the fuck was going on. There was less consumer spending. The tariffs weren't effectively in place for half of the month. Large retailers had inventory to soften the blow.\n\nPeople were predicting that the market was going to rip on a better-than-expected CPI.. but that obviously isn't happening, because uncertainty is starting to cut into confidence. That will continue to be the case the longer we drag on with the tariffs, which are fully in effect now on all shipments and will start to show up in the May report in June, and in the June report in July. The high-tariff on China is only a 90 day pause and there's been zero news about any movement toward an actual, durable trade deal with them. Not even a rumbling. They literally set up a phone line and told each other to \"wait by the phone.\"\n\nThis reinforces my thinking that May is going to still mainly be sideways in trading, probably a bit positive come the end of the month. I've switched my thinking that June is going to result in a catastrophic drop from the beginning, because at least with the 30% tariffs, shipments will begin moving again.. just shit will be incredibly expensive as inventories get replenished. So we'll see inflation ramp up through June and into July.\n\nThe \"pause\" ends on August 9. At that point, they either extend the pause or Trump has a temper tantrum and reinstates the tariffs. If reinstatement happens, it'll be a catastrophic drop. If it doesn't, we'll have a slow bleed recession as global supply chains are reconfigured around the US.\n\nWhat gets us out of this is if China starts indicating that a real trade deal is on the table and if Trump drops his tariffs altogether. Outside of that, I think this is where we're going.",

I actually told him to sell some of it a few months ago when it was over 700, and he refused because he didn't want to pay the capital gains tax, and because he thinks there is some secret way to not pay the tax on gains (90 percent of the account is capital gains, he bought way back in the day). It's nuts. So even though I hold zero META i follow the stock out of morbid curiosity. Is my uncle the best investor ever?\n\nI know another guy who is in basically the same situation expect his portfolio is 100% tobacco stocks. When i ask him advice he says, \"just do the same thing as me, all in on British American tobacco. Thank me later.\" Literally that's his advice for my main retirement account.",

Why should doctors not bear some of the costs of public healthcare? It's because doctors are personal connections whereas health insurer corporations are amorphous entities that are extremely easy to point at and blame.\n\nIt's similar to the student loan issue. Students and post-college people want their loans relieved, and blame any party or politics that are against student loan relief, yet there doesn't seem to be much of any blame on the people actually charging these tuitions, and increasing them much faster than inflation, ie the universities themselves? It's because if they blamed unis that they themselves chose, they would have to face the consequences of their own actions, but it's just easier to blame an amorphous entity like the government who is only the intermediary.\n\nHealth insurers are still at the mercy of negotiations with health providers.¬†**The only reason why some healthcare costs in countries with public options is because the government has so much bureaucracy and so much pricing power that they can just tell doctors and health providers to stop making so much money**. US health insurers have no such pricing power. Ever talk to doctors and ask whether they want to move somewhere with government insurance? Or ask patients in these countries the wait time for doctors because there is always a shortage because doctors make less money? In the US, doctors in fact make a ton more money compared to any health providers anywhere in the world, UNH only has a tiny 5% profit margin, other insurers even lower.",

But I still have faith that solar is a far better business than the current stock market realizes.\n\nIt‚Äôs free electricity from the sky.  That‚Äôs better than spinning straw into gold, because with that you still have to buy the straw.  Sunlight is free and (currently) not being tariffed.\n\nNot only that, electricity is everyone‚Äôs most expensive and inflationary bill.  Anything you can do to decrease or eliminate your most annoying utility *should* be a no brainer.  And it is a no brainer in the rest of the world.  Commercial or residential builds in Europe and other places, solar is top of mind.  Here we treat free electricity like it‚Äôs something only hippies would want but in reality it should be capitalist catnip.\n\nAnd if that‚Äôs not enough, consider our broken grid and one very broken political party that will never agree to repair let alone replace it.  That means we need very localized generation that doesn‚Äôt have as much grid dependency.  That means solar.  \n\nThe American downtalk of solar is interest rates.  But that‚Äôs a canard.  If you could buy a machine that turns straw into gold, would you take a loan for it?  I certainly would.  And I wouldn‚Äôt fuss about whether the rate is 3% or 5%.  I‚Äôd laugh that it‚Äôs only 5%.",

The market can certainly remain elevated (and delusional) while things with the economy are negatively affected, but I feel like all of this will come to a head at some point soon. Everything is hindsight but this feels like a ‚Äúhow on earth could they have missed everything leading up to that event‚Äù in the future.¬†\n\nIn 2008‚Äôs crash and recession, people look back and see how many subprime and no document loans were approved on the basis of nothing, different circumstances but this just seems like an incoming train wreck if you stop to see what‚Äôs around you.¬†",

Don‚Äôt listen to what the hive mind echo chamber of Reddit tells you when everyone is screaming this time is different and it‚Äôs the end of American exceptionalism. Make up your own mind and stick with your thesis as long as it remains intact. I‚Äôve already blown by ATH‚Äôs in my personal portfolio buying the crap out of this tariff dip.\n\n***The market will follow big tech earnings. The Mag 7 make up around 35% of the weighted average of the S&P500. So far Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all crushed Q1 earnings and did not disappoint on guidance. I believe Apple and Amazon will follow suit tomorrow.\n\nThe worst is behind in regard to tariffs and the trade war. Trump has completely changed his tone and rhetoric from huge reciprocal tariffs on every nation without room for negotiation to ‚Äúwe are looking to actively negotiate and make deals.‚Äù We have already seen what the worst case scenario was, and the has been slowly stripped away layer by layer every time a new carve out or exemption is made. Exemptions on cars, exemptions on phones, exemptions on chips, what else is there left to tariff? Cardigan sweaters?\n\nLastly, the cyclical components of the economy such as durable goods, auto manufacturing, and   residential construction continue to hold up. The cyclical portion of the economy is what determines the business cycle and whether or not we have a recession. Construction employment is still at all time highs. The economy in aggregate and the overall employment rate will not turn over and lead us into a recession until the cyclical parts of the economy degrade to a much higher degree.\n\nWith the worst of the tariffs behind us, corporate earnings from big tech beating expectations, and cyclical components of the economy refusing to collapse, I believe we continue to grind higher and will see a new all-time high at some point this year, despite the expected higher volatility***",

I sold at 5900ish with no tax liability due to a loss I had on a property, so it will end up mostly a wash. I'll probably sit in 40% fixed income still just in case we see a reversal.

And the parts for US assembly are mostly affected by tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\nBut as Barron's points out, the optimism likely has more to do with perception.\nChina is a huge market for Tesla, and any anti-American sentiment could impact its business there (which appears to be declining at the start of Q2 as well).\"\n\nDoes reading this piss anyone else off?

There's still too much uncertainty and people are making too much hay over one good day that has, so far, mainly traded sideways after the initial jump.\n\n\nI'm looking for China to make an actually positive statement that indicates a real deal has been struck. At this point, the tariffs even being at 30% is too much and there will still be a lot of pain in the economy that's going to translate into instability in the market, if it remains at that level. Also, it's a 90 day pause. That, in itself, creates too much uncertainty in the absence of any real news. Also, Trump is now starting to try and pick a fight with the EU.\n\n\nSome dumbass is going to come along and call this \"timing the market\" but I'm not looking for a perfect entry point for perfect gains. I'm looking for the headwinds to truly shift back toward stability. We're not there. If anything, more instability has been introduced now.",

If you are a bull and want new ATHs and not to revisit the lows, you want to see the market DROP BACK INTO the FVG, spend a couple days there, then rocket back out of it. If you are a bear you want to see us stay above it or near the top of it, then reject downwards.\n\nIf we close Map above these FVGs, I will still be bearish, but will likely take some long positions. I have out performed SPY by well over 100% over the past 5 years. I have periods where i perform like shit (2023 was -35% for example) and periods where I go beserk (ive had 3 different 3-month stretches of >100% returns since 2020)",

There was a series of events that happened after that period that signalled that while the markets were still turbulent, the headwinds signalled comfortably enough toward stability that you could ease your way back in.\n\n\nRight now, for me, we're in that period where there is too much instability and too much overall uncertainty about what's going to happen.

Eventually, however, the Chinese will figure all this out.\n\nIf you want to learn more, there is a book called Chip Wars that explains it. China vs the U.S. now is similar to the USSR vs the U.S. back in the day. The Soviets would take US chip technology and try to copy it, except they were always 5-10 years behind because the technology evolves so fast. The Chinese are estimated to be 5 years behind. There is an argument export controls will help keep them behind. The counter argument is export controls will spur the Chinese to become so desperate they will catch up to the U.S.",

          "body": "People who sat on the sidelines in 2020-2024 lacked the discernment to tell instability apart from uncertainty. Ironically, the same issue they have is the same issue you have; lack of discernment in situations.\n\n\nThe market then may have been unstable, but with the Fed's actions and with how companies were moving and adapting in light of the shutdowns and restrictions, there was still certainty that things were popping back and that they were heading toward a period of stability. There was intense government investment in keeping supply chains running until they could stabilize. Things were actually happening to keep the market afloat until restrictions could be relaxed, including an unprecedented public vaccine initiative. Those are all *positive* signs that the headwinds were going toward a stable market, even if we had to deal with some instability temporarily. Things were done to reassure certainty.\n\n\nThe difference between them and now is that there is no real signal that points towards a certainty that the market will be stable anytime soon. Tariffs are still high -- a 30% tariff is still difficult to cope with, especially if there is no de minimis exception that comes with that. China's only move so far was to setup a \"consultation mechanism\" which they've done before and it didn't do anything. There's no clear timeline to have a clear trade deal that doesn't result in ballooning inflation and cratered consumer confidence, especially heading into the latter part of the year with the holidays. On top of that, nothing Trump has done nothing that has engendered confidence that he's able to get a legit, durable trade deal. I mean, he shits on the trade deals he made in his first term, unknowingly to him that his team negotiated them.\n\n\nThe market is so detached from fundamentals right now that I wouldn't be surprised if it does hit ATH in the next month or two. I'd be equally as unsurprised if it just craters because Trump decided he wants to shitpost on Truth while he's in the middle of the McShits at 3am.\n\n\nThe only thing that I can see bringing any semblance of certainty back is if China themselves confirm that an actual deal is on the table and is ready to be signed. Beyond that, we're just going to have a casino until then.\n\n\nIn that intervening time, the bears and bulls can have it out among themselves with trading off \"gotcha\" days. It's a clown market until China says otherwise.",

I've been steadily buying dividend stocks ever since.  I have worked so hard to hit this goal which will fund our retirement (+SS).  Dividend holdings include ET, MPLX, WES, EPD, JPM, BX, META, CRBG, PFFA, SPY, QQQ + lots of no dividend BRK. \n\nPS: thanks for all the congratulations and support.  I also hope I inspired a few people to max out their retirement accounts, invest in dividend stocks, diversify!, stay focused, and ride out market crashes (I started after Black Monday, and rode out dot.com, GFC, Covid, and the Tariff scare).

I take out about $10K a year to buy toys or pay taxes. Now I have $190K in my 547B account. My 547B has way outdone my Real Estate with far less hassles. \n\nEven though my 547B is a small amount, I have 2 pensions ($8500), Investment income ($4K-$6K) & Social security ($1K). All of this adds up to between $13K - $15K a month after tax income. Before I retired, I only took home about $5K after taxes each month. Now I make three times that amount retired.\n\nI just qualified for Social Security and made my kids an offer to match them $1 for $1 they put into a Roth IRA (Max $7K a year, $583 a month) out of my Social Security check. Assuming I live 13 years, they will have about $150K. If they stop contributing when I die (Est age 75), at age 60 they will have almost $500K. If they continue with their portion, at age 60 they will have $775K. If they bump up to the $7K a year, they will have almost $1 million dollars! \n\nthis is an example of using time of an investment to leverage your investment to the max!\n\nI am already setting up Non-profits that will get about $1.5 million in assets and cash (before and after I Die). That leaves $1 million for each kid to inherit when my wife and I die.",

It was evenly split between a taxable account and IRA. I invested the proceeds in JEPI and JEPQ. So, I keep some growth exposure but cap the upside by selecting income from both using a derivative product. \n\nI am not saying there is anything wrong with a dividend strategy. Your investment strategy should match your investment objectives and your level of understanding of investment products. My background is in finance and options, ELNs and futures trading is within my visibility for my investment strategy. \n\nThis is not a recommendation of JEPI or JEPQ. It is just to say there is another way to garner income.",

I assume you reinvested dividends over that time period to continue buying more shares thus increasing dividend payouts over time? \n\n2. Assuming you have been reinvesting dividends, how much more $ did you put into the market annually on average? \n\n3. Not really a question, but about half of your holdings you mentioned pay very small dividend %. I think what you accomplished could be done even sooner if the whole portfolio was in stocks like ET, WES, EPD, etc (stocks that pay 7-10% dividends annually vs 2-3%). \n\nVery cool and inspirational to see! Enjoy that $ and go enjoy LIFE! Best wishes.",

I‚Äôve been able to keep my tax rate at 20.5% and avoid any claw backs on my OAS pension - dividends are great for steady income - but there are more effective ways to manage the tax hit and keep more of your money - unless they are in registered account - for an unregistered brokerage account  - capital gains and tax harvesting is the most tax  efficient method",

Its only value is psychological.  If you are evaluating where to allocate investments today, you would only compare their yields today, you would not compare their yields today vs their spot price a long time ago.  For example, it makes no sense to hold an investment yielding 1% today for the specific reason that its \"yield on cost\" is 7% because you bought it 10 years ago.  Today it's paying 1%, so if you moved the investment to something paying 3% you would be generating more yield.",

Next, we need to assume what his yield rate is. I chose 7% yield on cost, because they didn't magically produce their portfolio out of thin air in 1988, it would have been built up and contributed into over time most likely. For example, if you bought SPY at inception, your yield is 16%, if you buy it today it's 1.29%. 7% is an educated guess. I could be wrong in either direction by a fair amount, depending on what their holdings are. \n\nWith that out of the way, the formula we're interested in is yield = dividend / price. Yield on cost is one's yield factoring in the dividend growth rate and average cost over time, ie the 7%, so the same formula can be used. Rearranging, we get price (or average cost) = dividend / yield. Plugging in the numbers exactly from the start 1000*250/.07 = 3.6M. Hopefully that all makes sense.\n\nEdit: as u/Miserable_Rube pointed out, I have the numbers wrong. It should be 365 days not 250. The portfolio size would be closer to 5M.",

Sprinkle in a few high dividend stocks with covered calls. 5 years later I have $1.4 million, a gain of $400k on 12.5% withdrawal rate.\n\nExample, Sold NOV $25 BXSL Calls when I bought stock at 29.30, made 20 cents extra with calls, will get 2 divvy's before calls get taken, equates to 6.96% return for 6 months. 13.92% annually and very low risk. Since I am in a margin account with that money I still have almost my entire balance to still sell weekly Puts and Calls. Over 90% of my trades are successful.\n\nPractice option trades, mainly selling and don't let them fool you into thinking withdrawing only 4% is the way to go. Heck, you can easily put together a preferred stock portfolio paying at least 6%,\n\n4% rule is not something people should follow, a 60/40 investment is only if you want to wait until you have enough money to make 4% work.

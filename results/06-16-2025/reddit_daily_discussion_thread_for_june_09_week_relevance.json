Frankly, in 4 weeks we could see what tariffs feel like in America, and clearly the market has not priced this in, as it goes up and up and up. \n\nTill then, SPY 610 is a given, but the play is literally 4 weeks from now to buy SPY puts. Use the VIX to get a better handle on the timing. If VIX is at 12, that's an instant buy in my book for SPY puts, regardless of any external factors.",

You think Nvidia pumping 12% is “earnings”? Wake up.\n\nThey inject liquidity at key astrological alignments. The moon entered Taurus this morning—Earth sign. Stability. Bulls. Green candles. This is how they speak to each other.\n\nMeanwhile, all the copper ETFs are quietly surging, and no one is talking about how that correlates with dream signal interception.

Only time I’ve seen it go below 14 is when there was a major sell off post Don Jr interview and when there was an extremely red day when Tesla tanked. Otherwise it hovers between 14-15. When you look at its face value it’s a pretty good bet…..it went up to 18 just on the Don jr CNBC hype, just imagine the day the merger is announced. Since its shares you’re buying, you don’t have to worry about theta, just sit and wait. Worst case scenario if this play shits the bet you’ll still be able to get 10.60 a share. Which is not too bad since the upside can be multiple bagger depending on how many shares you have and what price it reaches during merger. If it’s anything like Newsmax, Webull, DWAC where looking at 5 to 6 figure gains easy",

There is nothing wrong with spending it that way though. Most people wish they had money when they were your age to have done things they want, money is more fun when you’re young compared to retired. I think if you know you’ll have fun you should do it, as long as spending the money won’t make you regret later. If you focus on yourself and find something you value while spending that money, even if it’s just memories, that’s perfect. That’s what everyone is here for anyway. I do think you should save money for your future though. You said you have no real way to get a career basically, and that should be something you’re trying to figure out. If you want to make 200k a year and live like you’re gonna live for the rest of your life, you’ll need to put work in. Though, that might not be what you find. If I were you, I’d give myself about 70k for a journey like you’re talking about, and the rest would be saved until I can invest it into the career I decide on.",

Most my friends moved out there too anyways.\n\nThe rest I plan to keep invested (not options, or anything risky, just stock) stock mainly PLTR and the dividend etf PLTY. The reason I say PLTR is because I followed it since IPO but never invested since I was always broke, not just because I made most of my money on it, I do believe in it as a company with exponential to grow. PLTY paid $7 a share last dividend date so I could earn 5k a month even if I didn’t put all into it.\n\nI recognize how fortunate I am to have what I have and to have it at the age I am and I wish to continue growing it. \n\nBut most my friends have already lived alone for years and I believe that 1 year period that I plan on being away would be excellent for my growth as a person.",

There’s gaps at 43 to fill and the biggest catalyst to push it higher is over. Genuinely insane that you’re wondering why it’s down. Shits up like 100% in 2 months. Who knows when those gaps will fill. But that’s probably my entry long term. Keep shorting tsla though. Surely it doesn’t go down unless the market tanks",

The coupon is 3.875%, but the stop-out yield is 3.972%, meaning investors demanded a higher return. That suggests investors expect rates to remain elevated or see inflation risks.\n\nBid-to-Cover Ratio = 2.52. This is a healthy level of demand (above 2.0 is generally strong). It indicates solid market appetite, but not overwhelming.\n\nStrong Foreign Demand (Indirect Bidders Took 67%). Indirect bidders are often foreign central banks or global institutions.

Investors are not fleeing U.S. markets, but they are demanding a premium to hold medium-term debt.

He stated that the previous hairball was wound tightly into his digestive tract and has set him behind schedule. Lutnick's surgeon noted that the surgically removed hair looked like a small dog.",

We've observed your recent participation in one such subreddit, prompting us to implement a ban. This decision isn't tied to any specific post or comment you've made in our subreddit but is a response to your activity elsewhere. Our research has identified toxic behavior originating from specific subreddits, leading us to segregate userbases. We're willing to consider unbanning users under the condition that they refrain from participating in toxic subreddits. While some have agreed and been reinstated, others continue to engage in toxic behavior elsewhere, prompting our zero-tolerance approach.",

Analyst Colin Langan notes a 23% year-over-year decline in May global deliveries and ongoing pricing pressures from aggressive financing promotions, risking Q2 margins. Despite Tesla's upcoming robotaxi launch on June 12, Langan believes it won't offset poor fundamentals. Tesla faces slowing sales, increased competition in China, and potential supply chain issues from Trump’s tariffs. The stock has fallen over 22% in 2025, worsened by recent tensions between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, though their public dispute has recently eased\n\n\n😂😂😂😂😂",

Despite recent value pressures, Jonas sees major growth potential in Tesla’s physical AI capabilities—like autonomous vehicles, robotics, energy storage, and manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nHe argues no other company matches Tesla's positioning in data, AI, robotics, and supporting networks. While traditional EVs face headwinds, Tesla’s broader tech ecosystem remains compelling. Jonas envisions future synergies across Elon Musk’s companies, such as SpaceX integration with Tesla vehicles and AI systems like xAI and Optimus working together. Tesla remains his top U.S. auto pick.",

You need to open a brokerage account (duh) with schwab, then an investor checking account with schwab, there might be a few delays if ur account is new, but start a transfer from your main bank account to the investor checking account at schwab, that will usually take 1 day to settle. After it goes to ur schwab investor checking, you can transfer it directly and immediately to your schwab brokerage account and be able to trade immediately.  If you have under $25k, it's better to have a cash account rather than a margins account, get to trade more often this way, but if you got $25k+, you can trade to your heart's content (or until you run out of money).",

So I’m taking a high-risk/low-reward gamble this go around.)\n\nMy earlier thesis regarding slightly OTM weeklies was validated. However, it happened before I wrote my limit order, so I missed it, and now they are wasting away.\n\nRevenge trading works! (Well, at least this is better than throwing more money into those flames, and this way hope to claw back some profit (the essentially worthless longs out-number the shorts.)",

My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.\n\nThat is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Many people have seen increased proces in things that have nationally gone down. Local government, particularly high cost of living areas, are known to tax things for whatever reason.\n\n2. While there are breaks for wealthy individuals in the OBBB, they do not cancel out the breaks given to middle and lower income people. In a perfect world we could fuck the rich and give to the needy, but in this world, in order to give anything to the needy, the wealthiest people often have to get a cut. Thats just reality. But like I said, giving a break to wealthy people does not reduce the breaks given to the working class. \n\n3. While the military parade has a cost, and im sure it isnt cheap- we can assume it costs less than the expense we paid Iran so that they could create a sesame street show. There will always be expenses that different people think are wasteful,  I dont even disagree on this point. But when I look specifically for a silver lining, what I can come up with is that there will be many vendors and adjacent workers benefiting from the tourism income this will generate.  Unlike sending 20m to Iran for a show likely to never air.",

          "body": "This is the link to the current effective tariff rate ~15%. Highest in like a century. Yet significantly reduced from liberation day as there is a 90 day pause implemented.\n\nhttps://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-june-1-2025?hl=en-US\n\nBelow is an excerpt from gemeni sourcing an NPR article that I will link below-\n\n\" Based on the latest reports, here's a summary of tariff income for the last two months (April and May 2025):\n * May 2025: The U.S. collected approximately $23 billion in tariff revenue, with total customs and excise taxes reaching $24.0 billion. This represents a significant increase from previous months.\n * April 2025: As of April 24th, the Department of Homeland Security had deposited $15.9 billion in \"customs and excise taxes\" (which includes tariffs). This was up from $9.6 billion in all of March.\nOverall, the federal government collected $68.9 billion in tariffs and excise taxes during the first five months of 2025, with \"much of the additional revenue came in April and May, after Trump imposed tariffs of at least 10% on nearly everything the U.S. buys from other countries.\"\n\nAnd as for the personalized trade deals, we can hardly estimate their effectiveness,  but common sense would say that they would be an improvement to the current trade scenario- otherwise we wouldnt push so hard to establish them. \n\nEither way, for 2 months we have have 15%  tariffs generating an average of 20b in revenue all while inflation has gone down and nations have come to the table. Too early to call it a success,  but trump said \"there will be short term pain\" and for what its worth, we saw the 5th fastest 20% crash followed by the fastest recovery on record, making his statement by and large accurate. \n\nWe could lower the effective tariff rate back to 10% (his main plan all along) across the board, continue generating significant income, maintain inflation, and prosper from renegotiate trade deals amd codify tax breaks and I really do expect to see a golden age of America where taxes are reduced effectively for the first time since ww2, while gdp grows significantly.\n\nThis was always a good plan, and if you think critically about why the media wants you to hate it, a lot of things will begin to make sense.",

I realized the more I tried to recover what I lost the more deeper I was going. Set a couple of recurring hundred dollar investments into sp500, nasdaq100 ETFs. Don't want to spend even one second on this anymore, I don't even remember anything that happened in my life in the last 2 months other than tariffs, taxes, Bloomberg stuff etc. want to refocus on living",

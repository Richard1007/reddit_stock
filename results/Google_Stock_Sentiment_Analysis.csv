Now they're talking about remedies. Personally, I think it's ridiculous that google has to sell of Chrome, as if this will ""make things right"". No sense whatsoever. 

Google earned its advantages in a very highly competitive industry. And it has always been highly competitive and still is. They fought with Yahoo and Bing early on. Then fought to stay relevant in mobile. Then won the browser wars by just being *better* or more liked. They are now fighting with Amazon for shopping. And now their biggest challenge is the AI risk that threatens their Google Search and they are fighting to provide the best models in the world. 

And people have used Google because overall, they like it the best. And for things they don't like that google produced, like Pixel, Google Plus, google workspace etc, they are not the #1 product in the market.

"I don't think people realize how much Google's dominance depends on Google Chrome as well as iOS exclusive contracts.

Most consumers just go with the default and don't bother to switch if things are ""good enough""

Right now Google's search engine is vastly inferior to AI search products. It has become terrible in recent years at finding what you're looking for, whereas AI engines are very efficient. Younger generations, which are usually the first to catch on to new trends, have ditched Google in favor of AI search products like ChatGPT.

Right now, Google is literally just propped up by monopoly tactics. Search engine default deals with android phone manufacturers, deals to have their apps preinstalled, Google being the default engine in Chrome. Their core product just isn't good at what it does. But consumers are slow to switch.

If the default search engine of Chrome changes, as well as Safari, Google is going to lose the majority of its users and therefore its revenue. The majority of people still using Google are not going to manually switch back.

"1. The actual number for desktop users is 79.43%. But this also includes Macbook users, and Chromebook users(huge in schools). If you only look at Windows(where Google is not default), the number is substantially lower, probably closer to 60-70%.

2.  Edge is a lousy browser compared to Chrome, so a lot of people use Chrome, and Google is the default search engine.  If it was the search engine that was the issue, people would just set Chrome as their search engine within edge. 

3. AI Search products do not show up in Search engine market share charts. So if I use ChatGPT, Grok, etc to answer my question, that isn't logged as search engine activity. So arguing Google has 80% market share is like Arguing that Kodak still has 90% market share of camera film and traditional cameras, so digital cameras aren't a threat.

4. Google's presence on mobile influences desktop decisions. If your Android phone comes with Google apps, Google chrome, obviously you want Google on your PC to sync with mobile.

"Well first of all Chrome is driving all of its users toward google search, their biggest cash cow, and other google services. Without directing everyone to a search engine chrome is worth almost nothing, and without Chrome google search would have less users and an eroded moat. Chrome as the biggest browser also gives Google a huge amount of power to push web standards and APIs in their favor. There's a really high degree of synergy here. You have similar synnergies with their other products. Take youtube - a good platform for injecting ads into user's eyeballs. They're gathering data from those same users through their google searches, through their gmails, maps usage etc in order to target the best ad on youtube. And their youtube watch history provides more data to show the correct ad in search etc. They use all this data to train their AI models as well. If this all gets broken up then each individual business is massively weakened. There are tonnes more examples like this - they host their products on their own google cloud without having to pay, for example.",0.1922222222222222,0.4489814814814815,positive

"Gemini, when asked what epistemic humility is:

Epistemic humility is a philosophical concept that refers to the recognition and acceptance of the inherent limits and fallibility of one's own knowledge and understanding. It's an intellectual virtue that stands in contrast to epistemic arrogance, which is the unwarranted belief in one's own intellectual superiority or the certainty of one's knowledge.
Here are the key aspects of epistemic humility:
 * Acknowledgment of limitations: It involves understanding that our knowledge is always incomplete, provisional, and subject to revision. We don't and can't know everything.
 * Openness to revision: A person with epistemic humility is willing to re-evaluate their beliefs in light of new evidence, different perspectives, or compelling arguments. They are not rigidly attached to their current understanding.
 * Awareness of bias and interpretation: It recognizes that our perception and understanding of the world are shaped by our existing beliefs, experiences, cultural background, and cognitive biases. We acknowledge that our knowledge is always ""interpreted, structured, and filtered by the observer.""
 * Curiosity and continuous learning: Rather than leading to apathy, epistemic humility fosters a mindset of ongoing intellectual investigation and growth. It encourages questioning, seeking new information, and engaging in constructive dialogue.
 * **Socrates' ""knowing that I know nothing"": This famous dictum from Socrates is often cited as an early example of epistemic humility. He recognized that his wisdom lay in his awareness of his own ignorance, unlike others who claimed to know much but actually knew little.
 * Avoiding overconfidence: It means expressing one's beliefs with a degree of confidence that is justified by the evidence, rather than making absolute or dogmatic claims.
In essence, epistemic humility is about maintaining an open, inquisitive, and self-critical stance towards one's own knowledge, fostering a disposition that is conducive to learning, critical thinking, and respectful intellectual engagement.",0.22895202020202016,0.5864141414141414,positive

      "selftext": "Hello, I hope you don't mind, I have a question about tank stocking.  I'm helping my kiddo with his tank, he has a 55 gallon that he has stocked with 1 (very old, it's his original fish and has survived 8 years and slow upgrades from a 10 gallon to a 29 gallon and now a 55 gallon) Buenos Aires tetra, one electric orange ram, 8 neon tetras and 8 corydoras.  It's got two filters, a regular and a sponge and tons of plants, mostly hornwort, water hyacinth, bamboo etc. He does a good job with it, and it stays super stable with a maybe 10% weekly water change.\n\nWith one of the plants he got an invasion of snails going on, so we went to petco to get some assassins to take care of the snails, but they didn't have any.  The lady working there recommended he try a yoyo loach for it and said it would work well with our set up, would be fine on its own (they only had one anyway) and assured him it would be fine added to our current set up.  He immediately fell in love with the yoyo markings, and so I agreed to let him try it even normally we would Google it first.  \n\nNow, in fairness, the yoyo does seem to be perfectly happy in there and is munching on all the snails, but now that we've googled it, Google is telling us that it would actually be much happier in a group.  I'm not opposed to a group, but I'm worried the tank can't handle a group because they'll grow bigger.  We're trying to Google our stocking, but Google is mostly concerned about the lone Buenos Aires tetra, which I understand, but I don't want to add Buenos Aires babies because our guy has been on his own so long at this point, I'm worried babies will just annoy him.  \n\nHelp, please?  Can my son safely add a couple more loaches so our current one has friends? Do we need to prioritize the Buenos Aires dude getting friends? Can our tank handle additional?\n\nFor what it's worth, my son also has a 29 gallon with one electric blue ram and 7 juli corydoras, we could move someone over if that would make things better, but I don't think the yoyo would be happy in a smaller tank. \n\nThank you so much!

You could get more I\u2019d recommend a group of at least 6 preferably more but only if your content with the idea of upgrading the tank in the future I\u2019d recommend a 75 gal as a minimum(but the bigger the better) if not I\u2019d rehome the loach they\u2019re a very intelligent and social fish. \n\nYou can try a smaller group of 4 as well but internal aggression is something to consider. watch for bullying make sure you have decor and plants to break line of sight. I hope this helps and feel free to ask any other questions.",

I have this fear of him overstocking and stressing all the fish out, I like everyone to be happy, lol. \n\nI am not necessarily opposed to a larger tank at some point, if it means he could consolidate everyone and just have one big tank, I'm just worried he would get excited and think he has three tanks now!  This is what I get for encouraging my kids in their interests, lol.  Unrelated, my boyfriend finds this whole thing hysterical and thinks I should just get him a 150 gallon tank and be done with it, I think he's underestimating my kid and we'll just end up with fish tanks everywhere there's a plug for a filter!",

And watch your ram since rams in my experience are a feisty little fish who sits around the same parts of the tank as the loaches.\n\nUnrelated but I though you should know I\u2019m not sure how long you\u2019ve had your ram but I\u2019ve had some serious issues with this fish I\u2019ve found that they don\u2019t do well unless kept in warm water like 82f and when kept cool are a fairly sickly fish so that\u2019s something you want to keep an eye on. \n\nLast tip for your sanity YoYos (and most loaches in general) sleep/chill on their sides and may look dead.",

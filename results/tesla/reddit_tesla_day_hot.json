I reached out to Tesla Insurance for a quote, and after waiting 4 hours and 20 minutes, I finally got someone on the line, only to be told they can’t give me a quote or even an estimate unless I’ve already purchased the vehicle.\n\nFor reference, I used to own a 2018 Model S P100D, along with two Model 3 Standard Ranges. We had three drivers on our policy, and our monthly premium was $416. After I sold the Model S, our premium dropped by $83 a month. Now, I’m just trying to find out how much a 2022 Long Range would add to the policy before I make a purchase. I don’t want to buy the car only to find out it will increase my insurance by $200 to $400 a month.",

I did have a fender bender and Tesla was an absolute pain to deal with for me, the repair shop, and the other driver. They kept calling me telling me that Tesla wouldn’t reply to their insurance company for days to weeks and asked if I could intervene. I was never able to get my adjuster on the phone,  ever. Didn’t repo d to emails either. I would have to call the switchboard and wait 1-2 hours to get questions answered and paperwork moving. YMMV I’m thinking about switching to Progressive before my next term is up.",

They can go back to hating *all* EVs, instead of holding their noses and giving Tesler a pass. And they already ignore all of Trump's crimes, so the news of him being in the Epstein files will be totally dismissed.",

The eagle scared the crap out of Trump. \n\nHe’s still the same scary cat he’s always been. Instead of confronting Musk he does the fucking passive/aggressive bullshit and does his best PeeWee Herman voice and says, “Oh, yeah? Well, I’m selling your crappy car! How does THAT feel Mr. Money Bags? 😭😭😭😭😭 Please come back, Elon!😭😭😭😭. I didn’t mean it! 😭😭😭😭😭”.\n\nI can’t stand either one. Musk is pretending he’s looking out for the middle class when it’s all about him and what HE can’t get, so fuck him.\nTrump is like the little guy behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz. When Dorothy pulls back the curtain and sees this tiny angry man she realizes that big, booming voice of Oz that scared all of the citizens  and kept them in line out of fear was a fake. \n\nWhen people have pushed back Trump backs down.",

The fake news won't show you, they’re probably back there writing about nonsense, total nonsense. \n\nBut we have—and this was my idea, they came to me, the head of Ford, great man, tears in his eyes, he said ‘Sir, what should we do?’—\n\nwe have the brand new, and it's totally sold out, you can't even get them, the Ford F-150 ‘MAGA-TOR’ edition. It’s a Raptor, but I said we should call it the MAGA-TOR. \n\nMuch better name.\nLook at the size of these things! TREMENDOUS. You could fit so many electoral votes in the back of this truck, it would be unbelievable. \n\nThey run on regular gas, none of this electric stuff that you have to plug in for ten hours. Who has time for that? And the sound… just beautiful. A real American sound.\n\n\nElon, he’s a friend, good guy, but he showed me his little cars. They go '...'. Very quiet. You know what these do? The horn—and I had them do this, a special request—the horn plays the first few notes of God Bless the U.S.A. \n\nCan you believe it? The media will probably say it's ‘controversial.’ It’s not controversial, it’s PATRIOTIC!\nThese trucks are so strong. So powerful. We had one tested, it drove right through a wall of fake news stories and didn't even get a scratch. \n\n\nWe're talking about trucks made from REAL AMERICAN STEEL, not that sad, weak metal from other countries that probably spies on you. They send us their little cars, they're not sending their best, folks. They look like sad little computers on wheels. Very sad!\n\n\nSo while the media is having a meltdown, we are putting BEAUTIFUL, POWERFUL, AMERICAN-MADE trucks on the lawn of the White House. Because we are proud of our country and we are proud of our workers! We are going to have a parade of these, maybe the biggest parade ever. It's going to be a beautiful thing.\nThank you. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS FORD!",

No other car company would've done that. \n\n  \nWe took a 700 mile roadtrip back in December and FSD drove the entire way, and even pulled me into a supercharger and backed me into the spot without me doing a single thing.

So even if you get an adapter to NACS (J3400) and your vehicle is able to use Tesla chargers, you may get around half the speed compared to a third party charging provider if your vehicles battery is higher voltage (800v) instead of the roughly 400v that Tesla's batteries are. There are some vehicles with 400v batteries that will get full speed at Tesla chargers though. It's worth noting that if you have a robust charging curve like eGMP, you may still beat a Model 3 from 10-80% despite having an 800v battery architecture. But people seldom charge that high into the pack. \n\nWhat's a hypothetical safety scenario that would be concerning to you?",
